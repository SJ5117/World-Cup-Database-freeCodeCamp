World Cup Database project from freeCodeCamp Relational Database (Beta)

This repository contains an SQL file that builds a Postgres relational database (worldcup.sql), a shell script that automatically pulls the data from a .csv file and inserts the data into the database (insert_data.sh), and another shell script that queries various results from the database (queries.sh).
